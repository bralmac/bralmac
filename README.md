**`Lifelong learner and problem-solver`**

10+ years as a problem-solver and technology evangelist. I am an aspiring developer and engineer, always challenging myself to learn more tools and technologies to improve my own skills and understanding, as well as share that knowledge with my peers and customers that I support.
I've been computer enthusiast ever since getting to use my first 386 computer at home as a kid and love getting to learn more and continue to share that passion and knowledge with others!

 <summary><h3>🧗‍♂️ My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started getting more interested in coding during my Intro to Programming course en route to my Associate's degree. I was intrigued by what we were able to learn and the possibilities of programming, but was unable to change my degree focus at the time. Once I was in my first Helpdesk position, being able to help and educate users across the company, I was able to take a PowerShell course and applied my learning to create scripts that helped expedite new user creation when onboarding new employees.
   Since then, I have dabbled in web development on and off, but have recently taken a leap in my journey and completed the Nucamp Web Development Fundamentals bootcamp. I am excited to continue my learning and to improve my skills and understanding of coding and programming across different tools and frameworks in order to prepare myself for entering the development workforce.
